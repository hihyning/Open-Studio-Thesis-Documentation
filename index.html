                <p>Welcome to Open Studio Notebook. This site is an open-source notebook for my Parsons CD thesis process, documenting research, references, and experiments in real time. By sharing the process of developing this year long project, I'm exploring design as a shared commons —– and invite others to learn, question, and research alongside me.

    <br><a href="https://elizabethgoodspeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Goodspeed</a> Afterhours @ Pentagram<br>
    <li>Grabbed these tickets so quick, they always post them less than 24 hours before istg</li>
    <li>After spending so long working on the thesis catalog questions she posed / Eliane mentioned having a personal chat with her since my thesis is relevant, figured it would be a nice moment to attend her talk</li>
    <li>Very well strcutured and paced talk about her hollistic practice as a designer/writer, loved how succinctly she put her approach to things (archive/history informed)</li>
    <li>Work that she ended up getting was based off this "branding" of herself that formed from her genuine interest, makes me think about how I project myself/streamline my practice</li>
    <li>I asked a question about her teaching practice and what her philosophy was: she wants her class to be a positive and happy place for her students, highlighting and pushing what already exists in their work rather than impose her own ideas onto their approach</li>

    <br>A Writing Practice<br>
    <li>I've fallen off my <a href="https://hyning.com/words" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing practice</a> for the remainder of the last year, but I think even my (small) progress ignited something in me, where I know I can conceptualise and actually write out something fully. Without that, I don't think I would be as confident in my abilities to write critically about design.</li>
    <li>Discussed establishing the tone of how the writing pieces present, moving from more research based--to personal reflections and examples</li>
    <li>Appreciate the onus given to the written component of the thesis, feels very important to me but sometimes doesn't feel like it fully translates to a design thesis</li>
    What I will bring next week:<br>
    <li><s>One weeek of free writing about the thoughts on my thesis topic</s></li>
    <li style="margin-left: 10px;">
        ↳ Try writing for different audiences? i.e. design friends, teachers (Elaine), myself, someone who isn't in the field
    </li>
    <li style="margin-left: 10px;">↳ Look back at my past writing to see the throughlines in tone</li>
    <li>New page on my process site where I add my writing and journal entries</li>
    <li><s>Read "Teaching to Transgress" by Bell Hooks w reflections</s></li>

    <br>First Thesis Class Back<br>
    <li>Moved from Beatriz+Lydia to Elaine's section, so refreshing to be in a new space w new people!</li>
    <li>Really enjoying the "ambient learning" nature of the class, where we have side conversations with other students about our projects, I'm still learning about each people's projects in my new class</li>
    <li>Talking to Elaine one on one was SO HELPFUL! TRULY A BREAKTHROUGH! She fully understands the qualms I'm having with my approach, particularly with this topic and how to best approach it</li>
    <li>Very illuminating and meta moment to hear about how my thought process is even indicative of the design education system itself--how I feel refrained from making the thesis personal to myself?</li>

    <li>JT: BFA @SCAD Hong Kong, MFA @Pratt Institute, MFA thesis on cultural appropriateion in design, works in wayfinding, active in nyc design/start up space</li>
    <li>The Future of Design Education: The current model is failing to produce strategically-minded designers, over-indexing on technical skills while neglecting critical thinking and business acumen.</li>
    <li>Redefining Designer Value: A designer's core asset is their unique perspective, taste, and ability to synthesize complex information, not just their production skills.</li>
    <li>The Primacy of Content and Conviction: Exceptional design is not an aesthetic layer but a deep, authentic engagement with the subject matter itself.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 10px;">Plaud (my ai recording tool) works really well! I like how it externalised and on a seperate platform, keeps things clean</li>

    <br>Publishing This Site Publically<br>
    <li>Sharing this site on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRCygctjvDQ/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a> and made an open call for feedback/schedule interviews</li>
    <li>Formalising everything for public viewing took much longer than expected, feeling like it is polished enough even as a process page feedback → feedback has been positive so far!</li>
    1 on 1 Feedback w Lydia/Next Week<br>
    <li>Figuring out systems I'll use for my interview, transcribing, editing, designing--rinse and repeat once I find something that works</li>
    <li>Prototype idea: design some container to hold the interview, thinking about book page sizing, preliminary file setup/layout</li>
    <li>2-3 interviews planned to start with as content to design with for friday</li>
    Project Brief<br>
    <ul style="text-transform: uppercase;">Open Studio investigates how design education can evolve to meet a global and culturally diverse future. Through interviews, fieldwork, and participatory research, the project culminates in a publication, interactive website, and public event that explore how designers learn today and how future systems of design learning might better serve an interconnected world.

    <br>Thesis Exchange 2<br>
    <li>
        Shared majority of my research so far and also my ongoing approach--prototypes are tools I have used to research so far, also sharing this site and its philosophy
    </li>
    <ul style="text-transform: uppercase;">Main takeaway: need to ground further on what about design education I am trying to investigate</ul>
    Feedback From Peers
    <li>Reflecting on the non-linear nature of design education, sometimes you can't fully understand what you're currently learning until you're further along in your education → so much of design education is "choose your own adventure"</li>
    <li>Lean into the CURRENT student perspective, most material out there is geared towards educators, make it specific to the time--what if I made a class proposal for Parsons?</li>
    <li>The importance of hierarchy, titles, degrees? I'm playing into it but there are also so many critiques of it in terms of accessibility</li>

    <br>Design Harder Book Launch @ Index Space<br>
    <li><a href="https://www.bookideas.website/design-harder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Design Harder</a> by Erik Carter, designed by NoIdeas, published by BookIdeas (NoIdeas new imprint)</li>
    <li>Essays critiquing aspects of graphic design, often looking at systems rather than individual fault, there's no perfect answer for solving these problems</li>
    <li>So many people attended this event! (200+) made me think about how people would be interested in design events looking at critique/book → it was also free which might be incentive</li>
    Finished book: Monday, November 3, 2025</br>
    <li>Finished reading Design Harder, made me think a lot about how I can structure my book for thesis and how I can make my workload feel less daunting</li>
    <li>Tackles some systemic issues that does not necessarily have "solutions" but is able to discuss them in a critical yet informative way → rele to the problem I have been mulling over </li>
    <li>Large part of the book is using history as a way to frame the point he is trying to make</li>

        <br>1 on 1 Feedback w Lydia<br>
        <li>Making the project more personal might resolve the problem of it not addressing every facet of design education</li>
        <li>↳ Who is your audience? If an audience is not represented, can just shift the angle to represent a specific one</li>
        <li>Feeling like I have to gather content/research before I can start the making process → making as a response to material in my research</li>
        <li>Can I make some prototypes that have "something to say" because of the way it is presented/designed? The design itself is the message</li>

        Concept Feedback w Beatriz
        <li>How can I insert myself into the project? Using lived experience can prevent highly specified critique/disagreement
        <li>Everyone designs with an accent, how much do I want this project to include it?</li>
        <li>Who do I want to reach with this project? Faculty/institution/prospective students--ultimaitely I want this to be informative but also hopefully make a proactive change</li>

        <br>Thesis Exchange 1<br>
        <li>Presented initial research and direction to peers</li>
        <li>Exploring ways to make design education more accessible and experimental</li>
        <li>Looking at examples of alternative education models and spaces</li>
        <li>Kind of meta: my thesis wouldn’t just be about education; it would performs education too— through research, documentation, and participation</li>
        WORKING THESIS STATEMENT<br>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px;">Researching and understanding design education, with a particular interest in how we might work toward a more globalised and inclusive system of design learning that supports the next generation of designers</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px;">I’m hoping to explore how various pedagogical approaches, cultural contexts, and material practices can be meaningfully integrated to better serve a more interconnected world.</li>
